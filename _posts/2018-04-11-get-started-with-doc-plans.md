Although doc plans still appear as Word documents in SharePoint, we no longer use Word templates to create them - they are 
auto-generated by the Create Doc Plan database application, which allows us to:
- Easily create doc plans without formatting the content
- Generate reports about doc plan activity
- Auto-generate consistent plan documents for review/approval

### Create a doc plan

1. From the Doc plans SharePoint page, select: [Create a new doc plan](https://mcafee.sharepoint.com/sites/techpubs/Lists/Beta%20Test%20Doc%20plans/Item/newifs.aspx)
2. Enter information about your new doc plan. Input is required only for the following fields:
   - Title: A short name for your doc plan (example: nac-221-docplan). Please don't use period characters (.) in the title. 
   - Select product name: Your product must be in the Product Names list in SharePoint.
   - Product version
   - Doc plan author
